# TransFacPred: Tool for Prediction of Transcription Factor given a protien sequence
 
## Introduction
A transcription factor (TF) is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that controls the transcription of a set of particular genes, and controls gene expression in the cell. Identification of TFs is a starting point for the analysis of transcriptional regulatory systems. Analyzing transcriptional regulation lays the foundations to understand how an organism controls the expression of genes in response to genetic or environmental perturbations.
TransFacPred is a Deep Learning based method for prediction of Transcription Factors.

## Web Service for TransFacPred
The protien sequence which needs to be classified will be taken as input, the processing will be done on backend and after that the the Deep Learning model will classify the protien embedding and the result will be displayed on the result text box.
